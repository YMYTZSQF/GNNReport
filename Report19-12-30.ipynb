    "Instead of going through thousands of different types of graphs to evaluate the difficulties, I choose to start with releted research to investigate what kind of graphs they used to test their generative models. As I showed in Table 1, only a few types of synthetic graphs are used and most of graph types are real-world graphs. This makes sense since these synthetic graphs are \"determined\", we have well-defined rules to generate them. They are already a bunch of libraries (e.g. Networkx) can generate these synthetic graphs. What intereting to us is the real-world dataset, they are not \"well-defined\" and we have to use models to learn their underlying patterns. How to capture the underlying patterns is the challenge."
