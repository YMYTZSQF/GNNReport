    "The results show that Strategy 3 could get better result than strategy 1. But it still can not get similar quality as the original GraphRNN. So I think next step we have two possible directions to explore: 1. Explore integrating with other embedding methods; 2. Focus on merging generated small scale graphs into a large one"
